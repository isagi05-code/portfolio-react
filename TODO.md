# TODO: Fix Errors in Portfolio App

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Edit App.jsx: Remove framer-motion import, remove duplicate code (second imports, USER object, functions, and incomplete second App export), keep the first complete App component with CSS animations.
- [ ] Run "npm run dev" to start the dev server and verify the app loads without errors, with 3D card and CSS animations working.
- [ ] Test for any runtime issues and ensure the portfolio renders correctly.
